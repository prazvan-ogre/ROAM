# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Engineering foundation: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind app scaffold.
- Supabase schema (content + activity tables) with RLS, version-controlled
  as migrations under `supabase/migrations/`.
- Demo seed data for the Kassandra 2026 pilot trip (`ro`, 5 days).
- GitHub Actions CI (install, lint, typecheck, build) on PRs to `main`/`develop`.
- `/api/health` health-check endpoint.
- PWA baseline: manifest, mobile viewport configuration.
- Documentation: `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DATABASE.md`,
  `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

### Known limitations
- No authentication — participation is anonymous/device-based (see
  `docs/DATABASE.md` "Security model").
- No product screens yet (Discover, Extras, Battles, Final Battle) — this
  release is infrastructure only.
- No error-monitoring service (e.g. Sentry) wired up yet — runtime errors
  are visible via Vercel function/build logs and browser console only.
- Single Supabase project shared across preview and production, only
  scoped apart by `is_demo` on seed data (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  "Environments").
