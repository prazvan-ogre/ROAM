# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Engineering foundation: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind app scaffold.
- Supabase schema (content + activity tables) with RLS, version-controlled
  as migrations under `supabase/migrations/`.
- Seed data for the Kassandra 2026 pilot trip (`ro`, 5 days): Day 1 written
  as real draft content in the ROAM voice, pending fact-check/approval.
- GitHub Actions CI (install, lint, typecheck, build) on PRs to `main`/`develop`.
- `/api/health` health-check endpoint.
- PWA baseline: manifest, mobile viewport configuration.
- Documentation: `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DATABASE.md`,
  `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Trip join flow: adult profile creation, child profile management, all
  device-based (no login).
- Home screen: day-of-trip, Morning/Lunch/Battle status, Final Battle
  countdown.
- Full Discover interaction: profile picker ("Cine răspunde?"), question,
  answer submission, reveal (with per-question reveal-message pools),
  Common Core, One Thing, personal Extra assignment (load-balanced across
  a per-question pool, audience-scoped adult/child), Explore links with
  click tracking. Progress persists across refresh/reopen.
- Content-integrity gating: Discover/Battle questions and Extras are only
  served once `verified = true` and `published = true`, enforced in RLS.

### Known limitations
- No authentication — participation is anonymous/device-based (see
  `docs/DATABASE.md` "Security model").
- Battles, Final Battle, and the feedback form are not built yet (next up).
- Day 1 seed content is a draft pending human fact-check/approval; Days
  2–5 have no content yet.
- No error-monitoring service (e.g. Sentry) wired up yet — runtime errors
  are visible via Vercel function/build logs and browser console only.
- Single Supabase project shared across preview and production, only
  scoped apart by `is_demo` on seed data (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  "Environments").
- The Discover round-trip against live Supabase has not been verified from
  this environment (sandboxed network blocks `supabase.co`) — verified via
  lint/typecheck/build and a local dev-server smoke test only. Please
  exercise the real flow on a phone against your Supabase project before
  trusting it for the pilot.
